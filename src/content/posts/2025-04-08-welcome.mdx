# Who am I?

Hi there -- I'm Travis. I'm a backend engineer with a love for building things
from the ground up: low-level software, clean APIs, scalable systems, and other
"from scratch" projects for fun. I have a Masters degree in Computer Science
with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, and I have been working as a
professional backend software engineer for several years now with opportunities
to design and build several large scale distributed systems.

This site is my little corner of the internet -- a place to document what I'm
building, what I'm learning, and what I'm thinking about. If you've stumbledl
across it, welcome. I hope you find something useful, interesting, or at least
midly entertaining here.

# Why I Built This Site

For a little while now, I have been experimenting with various side projects
around backend infrastructure, artificial intelligence, systems programming, and
more recently, operating systems and databases. I've learned a lot along the way
-- from reading specs and docs to writing my own drivers and simple kernel -- and
  I wanted a way to **capture that journey**. 

This site serves a few purposes:

üõ† Document my projects ‚Äî I'm working on a variety of technical projects like AetherOS (a kernel written in C), Worshiply (a SaaS platform), and a key-value store in Rust. I want to track the progress, share the architecture and design decisions, and reflect on what works and what doesn't.

üß† Organize my thoughts ‚Äî Writing helps me clarify ideas. Sometimes I build
something  and don't fully understand it until I try to explain it. This site will help with that.

üìù Build a writing habit ‚Äî I‚Äôd like to write at least one blog post per month. It could be a technical deep-dive, a design doc, a retrospective, or just a quick tip that saved me a headache.

üåê Share what I learn ‚Äî I‚Äôve learned so much from blog posts written by other engineers. If I can do that for even one other person, I‚Äôll consider this a success.

# What to Expect

The posts here will mostly fall into a few categories:
- **Project Diaries** -- Progress updates on AetherOS, my key-value store, and
  other technical explorations.
- **Design & Architecture** -- Thoughts on software structure, tradeoffs, and
  how I approach building something from scratch.
- **Developer Tools & Workflows** -- I spend a good amount of time tuning my dev
  environment, experimenting with Docker, CI/CD, build systems, etc.
- **Personal Growth** -- Reflections on career, learning, and balancing work,
  life, and side projects.
