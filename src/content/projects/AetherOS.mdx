A toy operating system for learning and fun - written in C, built from scratch.

AetherOS is my personal journey into OS development. It’s a from-scratch kernel targeting x86_64 with a focus on simplicity and understandability. So far, it includes basic VGA and serial drivers, an early logging system, and exception handling. It’s a long-term learning project and a way for me to sharpen my systems thinking.

## Features

- VGA Memory Driver
- Serial Driver
- Simple logging system

## Coming Soon

- Memory Management
- Filesystem
- User Space Applications

## Tech Stack 

- C
- x86 Assembly
- GRUB
- QEMU
