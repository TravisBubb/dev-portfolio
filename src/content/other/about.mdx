Hi, I'm Travis - a backend engineer with a passion for building reliable systems, developer tools, and low-level software. I enjoy working at the intersection of performance, simplicity, and scale. Whether I'm crafting clean APIs, building a custom OS from scratch, or diving into distributed systems, I love learning and sharing what I learn along the way.
